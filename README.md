# Storage-Smart-Contract
Smart contract written in solidity to store basic info on blockchain. Tested using remix eth editor and rinkeby metamask test network.
This is my first smart contract. I was trying to understand the basics of solidity: setting up file, syntax.
I tested the smart contract through Remix IDE
I deployed the contract with web3 injection where i used a test metamask wallet and test eth through the rinkbey network.
The smart contract stores name and numbers
